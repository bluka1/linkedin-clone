# LinkedIn clone

This project was inspired by LinkedIn redesign on Figma. You can check it out on this [link](https://www.figma.com/community/file/979273848820041488).

## Goal of the project

This project's goal was to practice my own skillset. I was following a lot of tutorials and made some pretty nice projects that can show my work, skills and dedication.
But never made big project from scratch. This is, in my opinion, pretty big project that can show my skills.

### Technologies used

The main goal was to practice my React skills so React is the man of the game. Beside React, I used CSS modules, React Router, React hooks...

### Design limitations

Due to lack of designs, this project works just on laptops and screens bigger than 1440px. I would make it responsive.
